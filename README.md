# Workout Power PoWA

A modern, open-source, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) revival of the famous **Scientific 7-Minute Workout** originally published by The New York Times and based on the 2013 ACSM paper.

This app delivers high-intensity circuit training (HICT) using only body weight, a chair, and a wall — no gym required. It is designed to be simple, beautiful, and effective, with multiple workout variations and full offline support.
